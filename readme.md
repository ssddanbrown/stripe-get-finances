# stripe-get-finances

Simple script to get some finance data from Stripe for basic account reporting.
This is really just a custom script for my GNUCash import flow, and this may change significantly as I optimize it for my own usage.

Not really meant to be a shareable project, but just making it public/open-source in case it would benefit someone else.
